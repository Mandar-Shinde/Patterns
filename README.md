==================

### Tools
* Visual Studio 2013

## Behavioral Patterns
**Command Pattern**
  * Object is used to encapsulate all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time.
 
**Observer Pattern**
  * Subject maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes
  
**State Pattern**
  * Encapsulate varying behavior for the same object based on its internal state.

## Creational Patterns
**Singleton Pattern**
  * Restricts the instantiation of a class to one global object

**Factory Pattern**	
  * Creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object

**Prototype Pattern**	
  * Avoid the inherent cost of creating a new object. ie prototype to create a clone.

## Structural Patterns
**Adapter Pattern**
  * Make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
